* Programming Under the Hood

This project has been discontinued.  Originally, I set out to update Programming from the Ground Up.  However, the move to 64-bit is actually a pretty huge rewrite.  In any case, I decided to just go ahead and *do* the rewrite.

The result is a new book, *Learn to Program with Assembly*.  
This book not only updates to modern systems and 64-bit assembly, it surpasses the old book in many ways.
For instance, I cover many additional higher-level language features and how they are could be implemented from an assembly language perspective.

This includes:
 * Object-oriented programming
 * Exception handling
 * Garbage collection
 * etc.

While the original book had a working malloc implementation, this one goes further.  
It still has a malloc implementation, but it also adds on a pool-based allocator implementation, as well as a functioning garbage collector implementation.

Anyway, I hope you check it out.  The link is below:

If you want to go to an even lower level, you might enjoy my *Electronics for Beginners* book:

Anyway, thank you all for your encouragement.  I hope you enjoy the books!  If you want to see what else I'm up to, you can check out my academia page:
